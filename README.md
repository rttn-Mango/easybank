## Overview
 - This project is a website for Fylo that offers digital-banking related services.
 - Modifications were added to the project such as different hover and focus effects, layout, and such.
 - Contents for the four other pages were also added to the project.

## My process
 - I initially started with the barebones of the site follwed by the routing of the other pages. After that was the styling of the homepage. Once I was done with the mobile layout,
 I proceeded to create the layout for the desktop view. Once I was done with the homepage, I went to the About page next doing the same process 'till I was done with the rest of the
 pages. Once the layouting was done, I then started doing the nav for mobile layout followed by it' designing. Once that was done, I did some minor refactoring followed by final checking.
